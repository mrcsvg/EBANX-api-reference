          Flag that shows if a payment is ready to be captured. Applies only to credit cards when auto_capture is set to false. Some remarks on this attribute:

          *A payment can only be captured if pre_approved value is true, which means that the payment has been pre approved by the credit card acquirer. Before capture, an authorized payment has status as PE (pending). After the capture, the status changes to CO (confirmed). A payment can only be captured if the status is PE (pending). *Payments must be captured in 4 (four) days, otherwise they are automatically cancelled.*
          **NOTE:** It can be changed up to 5 (five) days.
