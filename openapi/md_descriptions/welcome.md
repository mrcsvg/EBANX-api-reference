# Introduction
#### Welcome to the EBANX ðŸ¦„ API documentation
This API definition is intended to guide you through our integrations.
### EBANX Direct API
The EBANX Direct API is the transparent checkout (with no redirect) solution that allows you to accept payments by all payment methods and countries directly on your domain. Your customers will benefit from a smoother user experience as they can complete the checkout without the need to leave the store's front end.
All the requirements of the Direct API can be found in our [developers portal](https://developers.ebanx.com/api-reference/ebanx-payment-api/payment-reference/reference-direct-operation/)
