  summary: Set a token CVV
  description: |

    The setCVV operation is used to temporarily associate a CVV with an existing token. This CVV will be used by the next request made with the associated token and then discarded.

    The setCVV operation is useful for one-click payments, where you already have the customer's credit card information and cannot send the CVV from your server.

    For this method, you will need to wrap the request parameters in a JSON object and send them as the value of a parameter calledÂ `request_body`.
