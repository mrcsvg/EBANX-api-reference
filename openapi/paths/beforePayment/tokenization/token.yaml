  summary: Create a Card token
  description: |
    The token operation is used to create a token for a given credit card to be used for recurrent payments.   
    For this method, you will need to wrap the request parameters in a JSON object and send them as the value of a parameter called request_body.  

    > **Note** 
    > To generate the token and check the credit card authenticity, EBANX creates a temporary transaction that will not be captured.
    > Itâ€™s important to know that the tokens expire after 14 months of its last use.
