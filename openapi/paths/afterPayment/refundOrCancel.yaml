  summary: Refund or Cancel
  description: |
    The refund or cancel operation is a server-to-server operation to cancel payments or create payments refunds.

    When the refundOrCancel operation is requested, the following will occur according to the payment status:

    -   Open (OP) or Pending (PE) -- the payment will be cancelled (status changes to CA), and no refund will be made.
    -   Confirmed (CO) -- it will be made a full refund of the payment to the customer.
