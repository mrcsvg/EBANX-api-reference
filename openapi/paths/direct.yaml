    - Payment with 3DS
  summary: DebitCard 3DS 2
  description: |

    The main differences from a normal request are the 3 fields related to the 3DS authentication:
    - `threeds_eci`
    - `threeds_cryptogram`
    - `threeds_xid`   
    
    Also, since we are piloting with debit cards right now, the ``payment_type_code`` must be changed to ``debitcard``.  

    **Please note:** ðŸ‘€ For debit cards in Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· the usage of the 3DS 2 protocol is mandatory.
